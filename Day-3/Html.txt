HTML : 
    1. HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language
    2. HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages.
    3. HTML describes the structure of a Web page
    4. HTML consists of a series of elements
    5. HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content
Example : 
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <head>
    <title>Page Title</title>
    </head>
    <body>

    <h1>My First Heading</h1>
    <p>My first paragraph.</p>

    </body>
    </html>

Example Explained :
    1. The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration defines that this document is an HTML5 document
    2. The <html> element is the root element of an HTML page
    3. The <head> element contains meta information about the HTML page
    4. The <title> element specifies a title for the HTML page (which is shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab)
    5. The <body> element defines the document's body, and is a container for all the visible contents, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.
    6. The <h1> element defines a large heading
    7. The <p> element defines a paragraph

HTML Element :
    > An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag:
        <tagname> Content goes here... </tagname>
    > The HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag.
        <h1>My First Heading</h1>
        <p>My first paragraph.</p>

* Note: Some HTML elements have no content (like the <br> element). These elements are called empty elements. Empty elements do not have an end tag!

Web Browsers :
    > The purpose of a web browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari) is to read HTML documents and display them correctly.
    > A browser does not display the HTML tags, but uses them to determine how to display the document.

HTML History :
    > Since the early days of the World Wide Web, there have been many versions of HTML:

Year	Version
1989	Tim Berners-Lee invented www
1991	Tim Berners-Lee invented HTML
1993	Dave Raggett drafted HTML+
1995	HTML Working Group defined HTML 2.0
1997	HTML 3.2
1999	HTML 4.01
2000	XHTML 1.0
2008	WHATWG HTML5 First Public Draft
2012	WHATWG HTML5 Living Standard
2014	HTML5
2016	HTML 5.1
2017	HTML5.1 2nd Edition
2017	HTML5.2

The <!DOCTYPE> Declaration :
    > The <!DOCTYPE> declaration represents the document type, and helps browsers to display web pages correctly.
    > It must only appear once, at the top of the page (before any HTML tags).
    > The <!DOCTYPE> declaration is not case sensitive.
    > The <!DOCTYPE> declaration for HTML5 is:
        <!DOCTYPE html>

HTML Headings :
    > HTML headings are defined with the <h1> to <h6> tags.
    > <h1> defines the most important heading. <h6> defines the least important heading: 
Example:
    <h1>Heading 1</h1>
    <h2>Heading 2</h2>
    <h3>Heading 3</h3>
    <h4>Heading 4</h4>
    <h5>Heading 5</h5>
    <h6>Heading 6</h6>

* Note: Browsers automatically add some white space (a margin) before and after a heading.
* Note: Use HTML headings for headings only. Don't use headings to make text BIG or bold.

Bigger Headings:
    > Each HTML heading has a default size. However, you can specify the size for any heading with the style attribute, using the CSS font-size property.
Example:
    <h1 style="font-size:60px;">Heading 1</h1>


HTML Paragraphs:
    > HTML paragraphs are defined with the <p> tag.
    > A paragraph always starts on a new line, and is usually a block of text and browsers automatically add some white space (a margin) before and after a paragraph.
    > With HTML, you cannot change the display by adding extra spaces or extra lines in your HTML code.
    > The browser will automatically remove any extra spaces and lines when the page is displayed.
Example:
    <p>
    This paragraph
    contains a lot of lines
    in the source code,
    but the browser
    ignores it.
    </p>
    <p>
    This paragraph
    contains         a lot of spaces
    in the source         code,
    but the        browser
    ignores it.
    </p>
Example:
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>

HTML Style Attribute:
    > The HTML style attribute is used to add styles to an element, such as color, font, size, and more.
    > Syntax: 
        <tagname style="property:value;">
    Background Color:
        > The CSS background-color property defines the background color for an HTML element.
        Example:
            <body style="background-color:powderblue;">
                <h1>This is a heading</h1>
                <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
            </body>
    Text Color:
        > The CSS color property defines the text color for an HTML element.
        Example:
            <h1 style="color:blue;">This is a heading</h1>
            <p style="color:red;">This is a paragraph.</p>
    Fonts:
        > The CSS font-family property defines the font to be used for an HTML element.
        Example:
            <h1 style="font-family:verdana;">This is a heading</h1>
            <p style="font-family:courier;">This is a paragraph.</p>
    Text Size:
        > The CSS font-size property defines the text size for an HTML element.
        Example:
            <h1 style="font-size:300%;">This is a heading</h1>
            <p style="font-size:160%;">This is a paragraph.</p>
    Text Alignment:
        > The CSS text-align property defines the horizontal text alignment for an HTML element.
        Example:
            <h1 style="text-align:center;">Centered Heading</h1>
            <p style="text-align:center;">Centered paragraph.</p>


HTML Horizontal Rules:
    > The <hr> tag defines a thematic break in an HTML page.
    > The <hr> element is used to separate content (or define a change) in an HTML page.
    > The <hr> tag is an empty tag, which means that it has no end tag.
Example:
    <h1>This is heading 1</h1>
    <p>This is some text.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>This is heading 2</h2>
    <p>This is some other text.</p>
    <hr>

HTML Line Breaks:
    > The HTML <br> element defines a line break.
    > Use <br> if you want a line break (a new line) without starting a new paragraph.
    > The <br> tag is an empty tag, which means that it has no end tag.
Example:
    <p>This is<br>a paragraph<br>with line breaks.</p>

The Poem Problem:
    > This poem will display on a single line:
Example:
    <p>
    My Bonnie lies over the ocean.

    My Bonnie lies over the sea.

    My Bonnie lies over the ocean.

    Oh, bring back my Bonnie to me.
    </p>
Solution - The HTML <pre> Element:
    > The HTML <pre> element defines preformatted text.
    > The text inside a <pre> element is displayed in a fixed-width font (usually Courier), and it preserves both spaces and line breaks.
Example:
    <pre>
    My Bonnie lies over the ocean.

    My Bonnie lies over the sea.

    My Bonnie lies over the ocean.

    Oh, bring back my Bonnie to me.
    </pre>

HTML Text Formatting:
    > Formatting elements were designed to display special types of text:
        <b> - Bold text
        <strong> - Important text
        <i> - Italic text
        <em> - Emphasized text
        <mark> - Marked/Highlighted text
        <small> - Smaller text
        <del> - Deleted text
        <ins> - Inserted text
        <sub> - Subscript text
        <sup> - Superscript text
Example:
    <b>This text is bold</b>
    <strong>This text is important!</strong>
    <i>This text is italic</i>
    <em>This text is emphasized</em>
    <small>This is some smaller text.</small>
    <p>Do not forget to buy <mark>milk</mark> today.</p>
    <p>My favorite color is <del>blue</del> red.</p>
    <p>My favorite color is <del>blue</del> <ins>red</ins>.</p>
    <p>This is <sub>subscripted</sub> text.</p>
    <p>This is <sup>superscripted</sup> text.</p>

HTML Quotation and Citation Elements:
    > HTML <blockquote> for Quotations:
        > The HTML <blockquote> element defines a section that is quoted from another source.
        > Browsers usually indent <blockquote> elements.
            Example:
                <p>Here is a quote from WWF's website:</p>
                <blockquote cite="http://www.worldwildlife.org/who/index.html">
                For 60 years, WWF has worked to help people and nature thrive. As the world's leading conservation organization, WWF works in nearly 100 countries. At every level, we collaborate with people around the world to develop and deliver innovative solutions that protect communities, wildlife, and the places in which they live.
                </blockquote>
    > HTML <q> for Short Quotations:
        > The HTML <q> tag defines a short quotation.
        > Browsers normally insert quotation marks around the quotation.
            Example:
                <p>WWF's goal is to: <q>Build a future where people live in harmony with nature.</q></p>
    > HTML <abbr> for Abbreviations:
        > The HTML <abbr> tag defines an abbreviation or an acronym, like "HTML", "CSS", "Mr.", "Dr.", "ASAP", "ATM".
        > Marking abbreviations can give useful information to browsers, translation systems and search-engines.
    Tip: Use the global title attribute to show the description for the abbreviation/acronym when you mouse over the element. 
        Example:
            <p>The <abbr title="World Health Organization">WHO</abbr> was founded in 1948.</p>
    > HTML <address> for Contact Information:
        > The HTML <address> tag defines the contact information for the author/owner of a document or an article.
        > The contact information can be an email address, URL, physical address, phone number, social media handle, etc.
        > The text in the <address> element usually renders in italic, and browsers will always add a line break before and after the <address> element.
            Example:
                <address>
                Written by John Doe.<br>
                Visit us at:<br>
                Example.com<br>
                Box 564, Disneyland<br>
                USA
                </address>
    > HTML <cite> for Work Title:
        > The HTML <cite> tag defines the title of a creative work (e.g. a book, a poem, a song, a movie, a painting, a sculpture, etc.).
    Note: A person's name is not the title of a work.
        >The text in the <cite> element usually renders in italic.
            Example:
                <p><cite>The Scream</cite> by Edvard Munch. Painted in 1893.</p>
    > HTML <bdo> for Bi-Directional Override:
        > BDO stands for Bi-Directional Override.
        > The HTML <bdo> tag is used to override the current text direction.
            Example:
                <bdo dir="rtl">This text will be written from right to left</bdo>

HTML Comments:
    > HTML comments are not displayed in the browser, but they can help document your HTML source code.
    > Comments can be used to hide content.
    > Everything between the <!-- and the --> will be hidden from the display.
Example:
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
    <!-- <p>This is another paragraph </p> -->
    <p>This is a paragraph too.</p>
    <p>This <!-- great text --> is a paragraph.</p>

HTML Colors:
    > HTML colors are specified with predefined color names, or with RGB, HEX, HSL, RGBA, or HSLA values.
Example:
    rgb(255, 99, 71)
    #ff6347
    hsl(9, 100%, 64%)
    rgba(255, 99, 71, 0.5)
    hsla(9, 100%, 64%, 0.5)

HTML RGB and RGBA Colors:
    >An RGB color value represents RED, GREEN, and BLUE light sources.
    > An RGBA color value is an extension of RGB with an Alpha channel (opacity) - which specifies the opacity for a color.
    > RGB Color Values:
        > rgb(red, green, blue)
        > Each parameter (red, green, and blue) defines the intensity of the color with a value between 0 and 255.
    > RGBA Color Values: 
        > rgba(red, green, blue, alpha)
        > he alpha parameter is a number between 0.0 (fully transparent) and 1.0 (not transparent at all)
HTML HEX Colors:
    > A hexadecimal color is specified with: #RRGGBB, where the RR (red), GG (green) and BB (blue) hexadecimal integers specify the components of the color.
    > #rrggbb
    > Where rr (red), gg (green) and bb (blue) are hexadecimal values between 00 and ff
HTML HSL and HSLA Colors:
    > HSL stands for hue, saturation, and lightness.
    > HSLA color values are an extension of HSL with an Alpha channel (opacity) - which specifies the opacity for a color.
    > HSL Color Values:
        > hsl(hue, saturation, lightness)
        > Hue is a degree on the color wheel from 0 to 360. 0 is red, 120 is green, and 240 is blue.
        > Saturation is a percentage value. 0% means a shade of gray, and 100% is the full color.
        > Lightness is also a percentage value. 0% is black, and 100% is white.
    > HSLA Color Values:
        > hsla(hue, saturation, lightness, alpha)
        > The alpha parameter is a number between 0.0 (fully transparent) and 1.0 (not transparent at all)

HTML Styles - CSS:
    > CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.
    > CSS saves a lot of work. It is used to format the layout of a webpage.
    > CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:
        > Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements
        > Internal - by using a <style> element in the <head> section
        > External - by using a <link> element to link to an external CSS file
    > Inline CSS:
        >An inline CSS is used to apply a unique style to a single HTML element.
        > An inline CSS uses the style attribute of an HTML element.
    Example:
        <h1 style="color:blue;">A Blue Heading</h1>
        <p style="color:red;">A red paragraph.</p>
    > Internal CSS:
        > An internal CSS is used to define a style for a single HTML page.
        >An internal CSS is defined in the <head> section of an HTML page, within a <style> element.
    Example
        <!DOCTYPE html>
        <html>
        <head>
            <style>
                body {background-color: powderblue;}
                h1   {color: blue;}
                p    {color: red;}
            </style>
        </head>
        <body>
            <h1>This is a heading</h1>
            <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
        </body>
        </html>
    > External CSS:
        > An external style sheet is used to define the style for many HTML pages.
        > To use an external style sheet, add a link to it in the <head> section of each HTML page:
    Example:
        <!DOCTYPE html>
        <html>
            <head>
                <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
            </head>
            <body>
                <h1>This is a heading</h1>
                <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
            </body>
        </html>
    > CSS Border:
        > The CSS border property defines a border around an HTML element.
    Example:
        p {
            border: 2px solid powderblue;
        }
    > CSS Padding:
        > The CSS padding property defines a padding (space) between the text and the border.
    > Example:
        p {
            border: 2px solid powderblue;
            padding: 30px;
        }
    > CSS Margin:
        > The CSS margin property defines a margin (space) outside the border.
    Example:
        p {
            border: 2px solid powderblue;
            margin: 50px;
        }

HTML Links:
    >HTML links are defined with the <a> tag.
Example:
    <a href="https://www.w3schools.com">This is a link</a>

> The link's destination is specified in the href attribute. 
> Attributes are used to provide additional information about HTML elements.

HTML Images:
    > HTML images are defined with the <img> tag.
    > The source file (src), alternative text (alt), width, and height are provided as attributes.
Example:
    <img src="w3schools.jpg" alt="W3Schools.com" width="104" height="142">

HTML Attributes
All HTML elements can have attributes
Attributes provide additional information about elements
Attributes are always specified in the start tag
Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like: name="value"

The href Attribute
The <a> tag defines a hyperlink. The href attribute specifies the URL of the page the link goes to:

Example
<a href="https://www.w3schools.com">Visit W3Schools</a>

The src Attribute
The <img> tag is used to embed an image in an HTML page. The src attribute specifies the path to the image to be displayed:

Example
<img src="img_girl.jpg">

There are two ways to specify the URL in the src attribute:

1. Absolute URL - Links to an external image that is hosted on another website. Example: src="https://www.w3schools.com/images/img_girl.jpg".

Notes: External images might be under copyright. If you do not get permission to use it, you may be in violation of copyright laws. In addition, you cannot control external images; it can suddenly be removed or changed.

2. Relative URL - Links to an image that is hosted within the website. Here, the URL does not include the domain name. If the URL begins without a slash, it will be relative to the current page. Example: src="img_girl.jpg". If the URL begins with a slash, it will be relative to the domain. Example: src="/images/img_girl.jpg".

Tip: It is almost always best to use relative URLs. They will not break if you change domain.

The width and height Attributes
The <img> tag should also contain the width and height attributes, which specify the width and height of the image (in pixels):

Example
<img src="img_girl.jpg" width="500" height="600">


The alt Attribute
The required alt attribute for the <img> tag specifies an alternate text for an image, if the image for some reason cannot be displayed. This can be due to a slow connection, or an error in the src attribute, or if the user uses a screen reader.

Example
<img src="img_girl.jpg" alt="Girl with a jacket">

The style Attribute
The style attribute is used to add styles to an element, such as color, font, size, and more.

Example
<p style="color:red;">This is a red paragraph.</p>

The style Attribute
The style attribute is used to add styles to an element, such as color, font, size, and more.

Example
<p style="color:red;">This is a red paragraph.</p>

Country codes can also be added to the language code in the lang attribute. So, the first two characters define the language of the HTML page, and the last two characters define the country.

The following example specifies English as the language and United States as the country:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en-US">
<body>
...
</body>
</html>

The title Attribute
The title attribute defines some extra information about an element.

The value of the title attribute will be displayed as a tooltip when you mouse over the element:

Example
<p title="I'm a tooltip">This is a paragraph.</p>
