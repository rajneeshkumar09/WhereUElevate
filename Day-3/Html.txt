HTML : 
    1. HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages.
    2. HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language
    3. HTML describes the structure of a Web page
    4. HTML consists of a series of elements
    5. HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content
Example : 
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <head>
    <title>Page Title</title>
    </head>
    <body>

    <h1>My First Heading</h1>
    <p>My first paragraph.</p>

    </body>
    </html>

Example Explained :
    1. The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration defines that this document is an HTML5 document
    2. The <html> element is the root element of an HTML page
    3. The <head> element contains meta information about the HTML page
    4. The <title> element specifies a title for the HTML page (which is shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab)
    5. The <body> element defines the document's body, and is a container for all the visible contents, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.
    6. The <h1> element defines a large heading
    7. The <p> element defines a paragraph

HTML Element :
    > An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag:
        <tagname> Content goes here... </tagname>
    > The HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag:
        <h1>My First Heading</h1>
        <p>My first paragraph.</p>

* Note: Some HTML elements have no content (like the <br> element). These elements are called empty elements. Empty elements do not have an end tag!

Web Browsers :
    > The purpose of a web browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari) is to read HTML documents and display them correctly.
    > A browser does not display the HTML tags, but uses them to determine how to display the document.

HTML History :
    > Since the early days of the World Wide Web, there have been many versions of HTML:

Year	Version
1989	Tim Berners-Lee invented www
1991	Tim Berners-Lee invented HTML
1993	Dave Raggett drafted HTML+
1995	HTML Working Group defined HTML 2.0
1997	HTML 3.2
1999	HTML 4.01
2000	XHTML 1.0
2008	WHATWG HTML5 First Public Draft
2012	WHATWG HTML5 Living Standard
2014	HTML5
2016	HTML 5.1
2017	HTML5.1 2nd Edition
2017	HTML5.2

The <!DOCTYPE> Declaration :
    > The <!DOCTYPE> declaration represents the document type, and helps browsers to display web pages correctly.
    > It must only appear once, at the top of the page (before any HTML tags).
    > The <!DOCTYPE> declaration is not case sensitive.
    > The <!DOCTYPE> declaration for HTML5 is:
        <!DOCTYPE html>

HTML Headings :
    > HTML headings are defined with the <h1> to <h6> tags.
    > <h1> defines the most important heading. <h6> defines the least important heading: 
Example:
    <h1>Heading 1</h1>
    <h2>Heading 2</h2>
    <h3>Heading 3</h3>
    <h4>Heading 4</h4>
    <h5>Heading 5</h5>
    <h6>Heading 6</h6>

* Note: Browsers automatically add some white space (a margin) before and after a heading.
* Note: Use HTML headings for headings only. Don't use headings to make text BIG or bold.

Bigger Headings:
    > Each HTML heading has a default size. However, you can specify the size for any heading with the style attribute, using the CSS font-size property.
Example:
    <h1 style="font-size:60px;">Heading 1</h1>


HTML Paragraphs:
    > HTML paragraphs are defined with the <p> tag.
    > A paragraph always starts on a new line, and is usually a block of text and browsers automatically add some white space (a margin) before and after a paragraph.
    > With HTML, you cannot change the display by adding extra spaces or extra lines in your HTML code.
    > The browser will automatically remove any extra spaces and lines when the page is displayed.
Example:
    <p>
    This paragraph
    contains a lot of lines
    in the source code,
    but the browser
    ignores it.
    </p>
    <p>
    This paragraph
    contains         a lot of spaces
    in the source         code,
    but the        browser
    ignores it.
    </p>
Example:
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>

HTML Horizontal Rules:
    > The <hr> tag defines a thematic break in an HTML page, and is most often displayed as a horizontal rule.
    > The <hr> element is used to separate content (or define a change) in an HTML page.
    > The <hr> tag is an empty tag, which means that it has no end tag.
Example:
    <h1>This is heading 1</h1>
    <p>This is some text.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>This is heading 2</h2>
    <p>This is some other text.</p>
    <hr>

HTML Line Breaks:
    > The HTML <br> element defines a line break.
    > Use <br> if you want a line break (a new line) without starting a new paragraph.
    > The <br> tag is an empty tag, which means that it has no end tag.
Example:
    <p>This is<br>a paragraph<br>with line breaks.</p>

The Poem Problem:
    > This poem will display on a single line:
Example:
    <p>
    My Bonnie lies over the ocean.

    My Bonnie lies over the sea.

    My Bonnie lies over the ocean.

    Oh, bring back my Bonnie to me.
    </p>
Solution - The HTML <pre> Element:
    > The HTML <pre> element defines preformatted text.
    > The text inside a <pre> element is displayed in a fixed-width font (usually Courier), and it preserves both spaces and line breaks.
Example:
    <pre>
    My Bonnie lies over the ocean.

    My Bonnie lies over the sea.

    My Bonnie lies over the ocean.

    Oh, bring back my Bonnie to me.
    </pre>


HTML Links:
    >HTML links are defined with the <a> tag.
Example:
    <a href="https://www.w3schools.com">This is a link</a>

> The link's destination is specified in the href attribute. 
> Attributes are used to provide additional information about HTML elements.

HTML Images:
    > HTML images are defined with the <img> tag.
    > The source file (src), alternative text (alt), width, and height are provided as attributes.
Example:
    <img src="w3schools.jpg" alt="W3Schools.com" width="104" height="142">

HTML Attributes
All HTML elements can have attributes
Attributes provide additional information about elements
Attributes are always specified in the start tag
Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like: name="value"

The href Attribute
The <a> tag defines a hyperlink. The href attribute specifies the URL of the page the link goes to:

Example
<a href="https://www.w3schools.com">Visit W3Schools</a>

The src Attribute
The <img> tag is used to embed an image in an HTML page. The src attribute specifies the path to the image to be displayed:

Example
<img src="img_girl.jpg">

There are two ways to specify the URL in the src attribute:

1. Absolute URL - Links to an external image that is hosted on another website. Example: src="https://www.w3schools.com/images/img_girl.jpg".

Notes: External images might be under copyright. If you do not get permission to use it, you may be in violation of copyright laws. In addition, you cannot control external images; it can suddenly be removed or changed.

2. Relative URL - Links to an image that is hosted within the website. Here, the URL does not include the domain name. If the URL begins without a slash, it will be relative to the current page. Example: src="img_girl.jpg". If the URL begins with a slash, it will be relative to the domain. Example: src="/images/img_girl.jpg".

Tip: It is almost always best to use relative URLs. They will not break if you change domain.

The width and height Attributes
The <img> tag should also contain the width and height attributes, which specify the width and height of the image (in pixels):

Example
<img src="img_girl.jpg" width="500" height="600">


The alt Attribute
The required alt attribute for the <img> tag specifies an alternate text for an image, if the image for some reason cannot be displayed. This can be due to a slow connection, or an error in the src attribute, or if the user uses a screen reader.

Example
<img src="img_girl.jpg" alt="Girl with a jacket">

The style Attribute
The style attribute is used to add styles to an element, such as color, font, size, and more.

Example
<p style="color:red;">This is a red paragraph.</p>

The style Attribute
The style attribute is used to add styles to an element, such as color, font, size, and more.

Example
<p style="color:red;">This is a red paragraph.</p>

Country codes can also be added to the language code in the lang attribute. So, the first two characters define the language of the HTML page, and the last two characters define the country.

The following example specifies English as the language and United States as the country:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en-US">
<body>
...
</body>
</html>

The title Attribute
The title attribute defines some extra information about an element.

The value of the title attribute will be displayed as a tooltip when you mouse over the element:

Example
<p title="I'm a tooltip">This is a paragraph.</p>
