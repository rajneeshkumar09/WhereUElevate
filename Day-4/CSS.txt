CSS:
    1. CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.
    2. CSS is the language we use to style a Web page.
    3. CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media
    4. CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once
    5. External stylesheets are stored in CSS files

Why Use CSS?
    > CSS is used to define styles for your web pages, including the design, layout and variations in display for different devices and screen sizes.
    CSS Example:
        body {
        background-color: lightblue;
        }

        h1 {
        color: white;
        text-align: center;
        }

        p {
        font-family: verdana;
        font-size: 20px;
        }

CSS Syntax:
    > A CSS rule consists of a selector and a declaration block.
    Example:
        selector       Declaration      Declaration
           h1          {color:blue;    fontsize:12px;}
                          ↑    ↑          ↑      ↑ 
                    property  value   property  value

    > The selector points to the HTML element you want to style.
    > The declaration block contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons.
    > Multiple CSS declarations are separated with semicolons, and declaration blocks are surrounded by curly braces.
    Example:
        p {
            color: red;
            text-align: center;
        }

CSS Selectors:
    > A CSS selector selects the HTML element(s) you want to style.
    > We can divide CSS selectors into five categories:
        1. Simple selectors (select elements based on name, id, class)
        2. Combinator selectors (select elements based on a specific relationship between them)
        3. Pseudo-class selectors (select elements based on a certain state)
        4. Pseudo-elements selectors (select and style a part of an element)
        5. Attribute selectors (select elements based on an attribute or attribute value)

CSS element Selector:
    > The element selector selects HTML elements based on the element name.
    Example:
        p {
            text-align: center;
            color: red;
        }

CSS id Selector:
    > The id selector uses the id attribute of an HTML element to select a specific element.
    > The id of an element is unique within a page, so the id selector is used to select one unique element.
    > To select an element with a specific id, write a hash (#) character, followed by the id of the element.
    Example:
        #para1 {
            text-align: center;
            color: red;
        }
    * Note: An id name cannot start with a number.

CSS class Selector:
    > The class selector selects HTML elements with a specific class attribute.
    > To select elements with a specific class, write a period (.) character, followed by the class name.
    Example:
        .center {
            text-align: center;
            color: red;
        }
    Note: A class name cannot start with a number.

CSS Universal Selector:
    > The universal selector (*) selects all HTML elements on the page.
    Example:
        * {
            text-align: center;
            color: blue;
        }

CSS Grouping Selector:
    > The grouping selector selects all the HTML elements with the same style definitions.
    > To group selectors, separate each selector with a comma.
    Example:
        h1, h2, p {
            text-align: center;
            color: red;
        }
